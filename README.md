# Enterprise Application Framework

A working boilerplate code for Enterprise Application.

Goal is to develop a working framework for common enterprise applications using WCF/.net core as server side and WPF as desktop front end to begin with.

### Detailed goals of this framework: ###

1. Easy to setup
2. Easy to Adapt
3. Should support rapid application development in fast spaced enterprise
4. More focus on building technology infrastructure for enterprise application
5. Building framework using existing proved frameworks for different modules but still having flexibility to replace them
   Example of existing frameworks : Enterprise Library,Unity,Log4Net, Avalon for UI etc
4. When an application team adapts this framework developers can just focus on building their classses for business
5. When an application screen / application service changes it should not have any impact on other applications hosted in container
   So Modules getting added /modified are the only modules getting released 



### Why WPF as desktop front end: ###
1. Rapid front end application development 
2. Easy integration with middleware messaging application like EMS / Websphere MQ
3. Easy modular development with PRISM & feature rich UI development capabilities
